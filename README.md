# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking a vacant spot on the grid with their respective symbols i.e either "X"(Crosses) or "O"(Noughts). The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If the grid is filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
